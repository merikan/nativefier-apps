# Archived

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I don't use [natifier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) anymore because it is not maintained, therefore I have archived this project.   
>
> Note: Nativefier is unmaintained and has been publicly archived. It was built a couple of years ago before the ability to create shortcuts for websites in Chrome, or similarly on Firefox. Users who want to build and use their own website wrappers should strongly prefer these options as they are protected from security vulnerabilities by the browser's self updating mechanism.   
> see https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/1577

## Create shortcuts in Chrome
1. Open Chrome.
1. Navigate to the website you want to add as an app.
1. At the top right, click the `three dots`.
1. Click `Cast, save and share`.
1. Click `Install page as app`.

# Web pages as desktop applications created with Nativefier
